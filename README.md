# Intermediate_FoodRecipes

This is my advanced Food Recipes Project from PijarCamp in intermediate level. This project has more requirements and module used than the beginner project.

In this project, there is user registration and login. After the user login, there will be token to be used on the header that will be needed to access this application. There will also be Authorization to limit access for user. For example, user may not be able to delete a data.

The full requirements are:
 - Login & Register
 - JSON Web Token
 - Validate user role (0 = admin, 1 = customer)
 - Hash Password (using 'bcrypt')
 - Upload images (using 'multer')
 - File Validation (to validate file extension, such as .jpeg or .png)
